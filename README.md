# 🌺 Howdy, I’m Felicia!  

👩‍💻 I'm a full-stack software engineer based in College Station, TX and I'm always eager to learn and improve my skills. I have a passion for solving challenging engineering problems with code and have several years with JavaScript/Node.js, Ruby, SQL, React, and AWS! 

🎉 Most recently, I built Nexus, an open-source GraphQL tool that generates and deploys a GraphQL API from a user’s existing data sources and automates deployment to AWS. (React, Express, AWS EC2, ECS, ECR, Fargate, GraphQL Mesh)
